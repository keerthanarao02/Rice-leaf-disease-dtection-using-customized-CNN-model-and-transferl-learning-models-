# Rice-leaf-disease-dtection-using-customized-CNN-model-and-transferl-learning-models-
The dataset used in this project consists of a collection of images depicting rice leaves affected by three different disease classes: 
Bacterial Leaf Blight,
Brown Spot,
Leaf Smut. 
Each image in the dataset has been meticulously annotated and labeled by expert plant pathologists, providing valuable information about the regions of the leaf affected by the respective diseases.
This dataset serves as a crucial resource for training and evaluating custom CNN models and transfer learning techniques like AlexNet and ResNet50.
By accurately classifying these images, the developed models can aid in the early detection and effective management of rice leaf diseases, contributing to the overall health and productivity of rice crops.
